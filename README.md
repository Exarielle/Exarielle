- Hey, I'm Exarielle. Or Exa for short, if you like. 
- I like cheese. And sushi. Also I can't dance. I'm interested in learning basic code, just to get started. At this time of writing, I'm a complete noob.
- Currently learning the bare basics. Still don't know what I'm doing just yet.
- I'd like to collaborate on game stuff. Because it's neat. But first things first--learning what the heck I'm doing.
- I'm happy to get to know people! You can always shoot me a message at vegancannibalism@gmail.com
